#### Respondent ID
A ten-digit number used to identify a HMDA reporting institution. RIDs often require leading zeros to meet the length requirement. For example, if the source number is 12345, the ten-digit RID number is 0000012345. The number, which is **assigned by each supervisory/regulatory agency**, along with the **agency code** keeps an institution separate and unique from another.
